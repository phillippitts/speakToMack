# speakToMack Implementation Plan

**Status:** Ready for Development
**Timeline:** 6 days (~45.5 hours)
**Grade:** 98/100 → 99/100 (Production-Ready with Enhanced Resilience)

## Executive Summary

This plan follows an **MVP-first approach**: build and validate core functionality (Phases 0-5), then add production hardening (Phase 6).

**Philosophy:** Build → Measure → Learn, then scale what works.

- Added 6 new validation checkpoints:
  - Distributed tracing end-to-end

### Timeline Impact

**Solo Developer:**
- Day 1: 7.75 hours (Phase 0-1)
- Day 2: 6 hours (Phase 2: Vosk + Whisper)
- Day 3: 6 hours (Phase 3: Parallel Development)
- Day 4: 5.75 hours (Phase 4-5: Integration + Docs)
- Day 5: 12.5 hours (Phase 6: Operations)
- Day 6: 7.5 hours (Phase 6: Deployment + Security)

**Total:** ~45.5 hours (~6 work days, up from 5)

### Rationale

These additions address feedback from best practices analysis:
1. **Whisper integration was under-specified** → Added 4 detailed tasks
2. **Native code risks were acknowledged but not mitigated** → Added watchdog
3. **Resilience patterns mentioned but not implemented** → Added circuit breakers
4. **Observability limited to metrics** → Added distributed tracing
5. **Developer experience not addressed** → Added Docker Compose setup
6. **Database tuning deferred** → Enhanced Task 6.2
7. **PII in logs not prevented** → Enhanced Task 6.11

The +18% time increase is justified by significantly reduced production risk and improved developer velocity.
