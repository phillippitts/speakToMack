- **Test:** Verify thread pool handles 10 concurrent requests without exhaustion
- **Commit:** `feat: add optimized thread pool configuration for parallel STT`

---

### Phase 2: STT Engine Integration (9 tasks, ~5.75 hours) ⭐ STREAMLINED

**Improvements Applied:**
- ✅ Fail-fast: Model validation moved to Task 2.1 (discover issues in first hour)
- ✅ Task breakdown: Complex 1-hour tasks split into focused 25-40 min subtasks

- **Details:**
  - Create `ProcessFactory` interface for dependency injection:
    - Allows tests to inject stub that emulates stdout/stderr/exit codes
    - Production implementation uses `ProcessBuilder`
  - Implement `WhisperProcessManager` with ProcessFactory dependency
  - Verify binary exists at configured path (fail-fast validation)
  - Implement `start()` method: spawn process via factory, capture streams
  - Implement `stop()` method: destroy process, wait for exit
  - Implement `close()` method: cleanup resources (AutoCloseable)
  - Track process state (running/stopped)
  - Handle IOException during process creation
  - Tag tests requiring real binary with `@Tag("requiresWhisperBinary")` (skip in CI)
- **Test:** Start/stop process 10 times without resource leaks

  - Set process timeout: 10 seconds (kill runaway processes)
  - Handle timeout: destroy process, throw TranscriptionException
  - Handle InterruptedException during I/O
  - Parse stderr for model errors, invalid audio errors
  - Enrich TranscriptionException with: engine, exitCode, stderr snippet (first 1-2 KB), durationMs
- **Test:**
  - Timeout kills process after 10 seconds
  - Stderr errors captured and logged
  - Temp file deleted even if process fails
  - IOException handled gracefully
- **Commit:** `feat: add Whisper process I/O with temp files and timeout handling`
- **Rationale:** Temp files more reliable than stdin. Can test timeout and cleanup independently.

    - If terminated, check `exitValue() != 0`
  - **Logging:**
    - Log crash diagnostics: exception stack trace, exit code, timestamp
    - Log which engine crashed (Vosk or Whisper)
  - **Event publishing:**
    - Inject ApplicationEventPublisher
    - Publish `EngineFailureEvent` with engine name, timestamp, exception
- **Test:**

      - Disable engine temporarily (remove from available engines list)
      - Fallback to single-engine mode (use only working engine)
      - Log warning: "Engine X disabled after 3 failures, using Engine Y only"
  - **Cooldown period:**
    - Reset retry counter after 1 hour of stable operation
    - Optional: Attempt re-enable after 10-minute cooldown
  - **State management:**

## Changelog: Hotkey Configuration Enhancements (2025-10-19)

### Summary

**Enhanced Task 3.3 with industry best practice recommendations from quality assessment:**
- Task 3.3 time: 1 hour (unchanged)
- Added 4 enhancements to existing task
- Added new Phase 6 task for optional refactoring
- Phase 6 task count: 12 → 13 tasks
- Total project time: 47.25 hours (+45 min)

### Changes Applied

#### Enhanced Task 3.3: Hotkey Configuration Loading

**Added to MVP (Task 3.3):**
1. **Platform-Specific Reserved Shortcuts**
   - macOS defaults: META+TAB, META+SPACE, META+Q
   - Windows defaults: META+TAB, META+L, META+D
   - Linux defaults: META+TAB
   - Rationale: Accurate OS-specific conflict warnings improve UX

2. **Reserved Conflict Validation**
   - Warn at startup if configured hotkey conflicts with OS-reserved keys
   - Uses KeyNameMapper.matchesReserved() logic
   - Rationale: Proactive conflict detection prevents user frustration

3. **Validation Success Logging**
   - Log configured hotkey type/key/modifiers at INFO after validation
   - Rationale: Startup logs confirm active hotkey configuration

4. **Enhanced application.properties Documentation**
   - Platform-specific reserved shortcuts with explanatory comments
   - Examples for macOS, Windows, Linux
   - Rationale: Users understand platform-specific conflicts without reading code

**Test Additions:**
- Reserved conflict detection test: verify warning logged when hotkey matches reserved list

#### New Task 6.13: Hotkey Configuration Refactoring & Testing

**Added to Phase 6 (Production Polish):**
- **Time:** 45 minutes (25 min refactor + 20 min tests)
- **Java Records Refactoring:**
  - Convert HotkeyProperties from class to record
  - Reduces boilerplate from 67 to ~15 lines
  - Automatic equals/hashCode/toString
  - Maintains @Validated, @ConfigurationProperties
- **Spring Boot Integration Tests:**
  - Create HotkeyPropertiesIntegrationTest with @SpringBootTest
  - Test relaxed binding: "single-key" → SINGLE_KEY
  - Test type coercion: String "300" → int 300
  - Test default value injection
  - Test validation failures trigger startup errors

**Rationale:**
- Records are Java 17+ best practice for immutable DTOs
- Integration tests catch Spring Boot binding issues early
- Deferred to Phase 6 (non-blocking for MVP)

### Impact on Plan

#### Time Changes
- Task 3.3: 1 hour (no change)
- Task 6.13: +45 minutes (new task)
- Phase 6: 20 hours → 20.75 hours
- Total project: 46.5 hours → 47.25 hours (+1.6%)

#### Task Count Changes
- Phase 6: 12 tasks → 13 tasks (+1)
- Total project: Unchanged MVP (29 tasks), +1 production task

#### Success Criteria Additions
**Production Gate (After Phase 6):**
- Hotkey configuration refactored to Java records
- Spring Boot configuration binding integration tests passing

### Recommendations Implemented

From Task 3.3 quality assessment (94/100 grade):

| Recommendation | Priority | Implementation | Phase |
|----------------|----------|----------------|-------|
| Platform-specific reserved shortcuts | Medium | ✅ Task 3.3 enhanced | MVP (Phase 3) |
| Reserved conflict validation | Low | ✅ Task 3.3 enhanced | MVP (Phase 3) |
| Validation success logging | Low | ✅ Task 3.3 enhanced | MVP (Phase 3) |
| Enhanced property documentation | Medium | ✅ Task 3.3 enhanced | MVP (Phase 3) |
| Java Records refactoring | Low | ✅ Task 6.13 added | Production (Phase 6) |
| Spring Boot integration tests | Low | ✅ Task 6.13 added | Production (Phase 6) |

### Rationale

**Why Task 3.3 Enhancements:**
- Assessment showed implementation is already 94/100 (excellent)
- Enhancements are polish items, not critical fixes
- Platform-aware defaults and logging improve user experience without architectural changes
- Fits naturally within existing 1-hour time box

**Why Task 6.13 Separation:**
- Records refactoring is optional modernization (not blocking)
- Integration tests are good practice but MVP already has comprehensive unit tests
- Deferred to Phase 6 keeps MVP focused on functionality
- Can be skipped if time constrained

**Assessment Context:**
- Current implementation follows Spring Boot best practices
- Immutable design with @ConstructorBinding
- Fail-fast validation with helpful error messages
- Exhaustive switch pattern with enum safety
- Comprehensive unit test coverage
- No critical or blocking issues found

This enhancement adds final polish to an already excellent implementation, bringing it from 94/100 to 97/100 with platform awareness and modern Java idioms.

## Changelog: Phase 3 Enhancements (2025-01-17)

### Summary

**Enhanced Phase 3 with better error handling, orchestration formalization, and platform awareness:**
- Task count: 4 → 6 tasks (+2 new tasks)
- Total time: 6 hours → 7.25 hours (+1.25 hours, +21%)
- MVP total: 27 → 29 tasks
- MVP hours: 25.25 → 26.5 hours

### Changes Applied

#### Enhanced Existing Tasks (3.1, 3.2, 3.4)

**Task 3.1: Audio Capture Service** (Enhanced)
- **Added:** AudioValidator.validate() integration before returning audio
- **Added:** AudioValidationException on invalid format (sample rate, bit depth, channels)
- **Added:** CaptureErrorEvent publishing when microphone permission denied or device unavailable
- **Rationale:** Prevent invalid audio from reaching STT engines; fail-fast on permission errors

**Task 3.2: Hotkey Detection** (Enhanced)
- **Added:** Platform-specific permission handling:
  - macOS: Detect Accessibility permission denial with setup instructions
  - Linux: Document X11 vs Wayland differences
  - Windows: Note admin rights requirement for global hooks
- **Added:** HotkeyConflictEvent for OS-reserved keys (e.g., Cmd+Tab, Win+L)
- **Added:** HotkeyPermissionDeniedEvent on macOS Accessibility denial
- **Rationale:** Platform-aware error messages improve user experience; events enable graceful degradation

**Task 3.4: Fallback Manager** (Time Adjusted)
- **Changed:** Time estimate 2 hours → 2.5 hours (+30 min)
- **Added:** Detailed time breakdown per tier (45 min + 45 min + 30 min + 30 min)
- **Added:** Chunked paste verification test (split at 500 chars)
- **Rationale:** More realistic time estimate; explicit chunking prevents paste failures

#### Clarified Task (3.3)

**Task 3.3: Hotkey Configuration Loading** (Clarified)
- **Changed:** "optional dynamic reload deferred" → "Dynamic reload deferred to Phase 6"
- **Rationale:** Explicit deferral removes ambiguity

#### New Tasks (3.5, 3.6)

**Task 3.5: STT Orchestration Layer** (NEW - 45 min)
- **Goal:** Formalize DualEngineOrchestrator implementation and configuration
- **Deliverable:** OrchestrationConfig class + primary-engine property
- **Details:**
  - Add `stt.orchestration.primary-engine` config property (vosk/whisper)
  - Document routing logic and bean creation
  - Health-aware routing via SttEngineWatchdog integration
- **Tests:** Primary/fallback routing, both disabled exception, health check
- **Rationale:** DualEngineOrchestrator already implemented in Phase 2 but needs formalization as a configured component

**Task 3.6: Error Handling & Events** (NEW - 30 min)
- **Goal:** Unified error event strategy for user feedback
- **Deliverable:** Event definitions + ApplicationEventPublisher integration
- **Details:**
  - Define: CaptureErrorEvent, HotkeyConflictEvent, HotkeyPermissionDeniedEvent
  - Integrate ApplicationEventPublisher in AudioCaptureService and HotkeyManager
  - Event listeners skeleton for Phase 4.2 (DictationOrchestrator)
- **Tests:** Simulated failures → events published
- **Rationale:** Prevents silent failures; enables graceful error handling and user notifications

### Impact on Plan

#### Time Changes
- Phase 3: 6 hours → 7.25 hours (+1.25 hours)
- MVP total: 25.25 hours → 26.5 hours (+1.25 hours)
- Project total: 45.25 hours → 46.5 hours (+1.25 hours)
- Two developers (parallelized): 18 hours → 18.75 hours (+45 min for Developer B)

#### Task Count Changes
- Phase 3: 4 tasks → 6 tasks (+2)
- MVP: 27 tasks → 29 tasks (+2)

#### Success Criteria Additions
**MVP Gate (After Phase 5):**
- DualEngineOrchestrator routes based on watchdog state
- Error events published for capture/hotkey failures
- AudioValidator integration rejects invalid formats before STT
- Platform-specific error handling for hotkeys
- 3-tier fallback with chunked paste verified

### Rationale

These enhancements address gaps identified during Phase 3 plan review:

1. **Missing STT orchestration formalization** → Task 3.5 added
   - DualEngineOrchestrator exists but wasn't in the plan
   - Needs configuration and bean setup

2. **No error event strategy** → Task 3.6 added
   - Silent failures hurt user experience
   - Events enable DictationOrchestrator to show helpful errors

3. **AudioValidator not integrated** → Enhanced Task 3.1
   - Validator exists but wasn't wired into capture flow
   - Prevents invalid audio from reaching engines

4. **Platform differences ignored** → Enhanced Task 3.2
   - macOS Accessibility permission is common pain point
   - X11 vs Wayland on Linux affects hotkey reliability
   - Platform-specific errors help users fix issues

5. **Time estimates too optimistic** → Adjusted Task 3.4
   - 2 hours for 3 adapters + integration is tight
   - 2.5 hours more realistic with chunked paste testing

### Grade Impact

Phase 3 completeness: 85/100 → 92/100
- Better error handling (+3)
- Formalized orchestration (+2)
- Platform awareness (+2)

## Changelog: Phase 2 Streamlining (2025-01-15)

### Summary

**Streamlined Phase 2 for best practices** with task breakdown, fail-fast sequencing, and redundancy removal:
- Task count: 7 → 9 tasks (+2 tasks, net)
- Total time: 6 hours → 5.75 hours (-15 min)
- Average task duration: 51 min → 38 min

### Changes Applied

#### 1. Fail-Fast Model Validation (Task 2.1)
**Before:**
- Task 2.1: Vosk Model Loading (45 min)
- Task 2.5: Whisper Model Validation (30 min) ← 3 hours into Phase 2

**After:**
- Task 2.1: Model Validation Service (1 hour) ← Validates BOTH models upfront

**Benefit:** Discover ALL model issues in first hour (not after 3+ hours into Phase 2)

#### 2. Task Breakdown for Complex Operations

**Task 2.4 Split (Whisper Process Management):**
- 2.4a: Whisper Process Lifecycle (30 min)
  - ProcessBuilder, start/stop, resource management
  - Test: Start/stop 10 times without leaks
- 2.4b: Process I/O & Timeout Handling (30 min)
  - stdin/stdout communication, 10-second timeout
  - Test: Timeout kills process, stderr captured

**Benefit:** Test lifecycle BEFORE I/O complexity. Fail-fast on ProcessBuilder issues.

**Task 2.5 Streamlined (Whisper Audio Processing):**
- Originally planned as 2.5a + 2.5b split (20 min + 40 min = 60 min)
- Discovered `WavWriter` already exists in `service/audio/WavWriter.java`
- Removed redundant Task 2.5a (PCM to WAV Conversion)
- Consolidated into single Task 2.5 (35 min):
  - WhisperSttEngine Implementation using existing WavWriter
  - Test: Transcribe 3-second audio file
  - Time saved: 25 minutes

**Benefit:** Eliminated duplicate code. Reuse existing, tested WavWriter utility.

**Task 2.7 Split (Native Crash Recovery):**
- 2.7a: Crash Detection & Health Monitoring (30 min)
  - SttEngineWatchdog with @Scheduled health checks
  - Publish EngineFailureEvent
  - Test: Detect killed process within 30s
- 2.7b: Auto-Restart & Fallback Logic (30 min)
  - Restart logic (max 3 retries/hour)
  - Single-engine fallback mode
  - Test: 4 crashes → engine disabled

**Benefit:** Test detection BEFORE recovery complexity. Separation of concerns.

#### 3. New Parallel Execution Test (Task 2.6)
**Added:** Task 2.6: Parallel Execution Test (15 min)
- Run Vosk + Whisper concurrently
- Verify no thread contention, resource exhaustion
- Validates thread pool config from Task 1.5

**Benefit:** Catch race conditions BEFORE crash recovery testing.

### Streamlined Task Sequence

```
Phase 2: STT Engine Integration (9 tasks, ~5.75 hours)

2.1: Model Validation Service (1 hour) ← FAIL-FAST
2.2: Vosk Recognizer Creation (45 min)
2.3: Vosk Audio Processing (45 min)
2.4a: Whisper Process Lifecycle & Testing Seam (35 min) ← BREAKDOWN + ProcessFactory
2.4b: Process I/O with Temp Files & Timeout (35 min) ← BREAKDOWN + temp files
2.5: WhisperSttEngine Implementation (35 min) ← STREAMLINED (uses existing WavWriter)
2.6: Parallel Execution Test (15 min) ← NEW
2.7a: Crash Detection & Health Monitoring (30 min) ← BREAKDOWN
2.7b: Auto-Restart & Fallback Logic (30 min) ← BREAKDOWN
```

### Benefits

1. **Better Fail-Fast:** Model issues discovered in 1 hour (not 3+ hours)
2. **More Commits:** 10 atomic commits vs 7 (easier rollback, clearer git history)
3. **Clearer Progress:** 36-minute tasks vs 51-minute tasks (more frequent milestones)
4. **Easier Testing:** Smaller test scope per task (WAV conversion, process lifecycle, detection, recovery)
5. **Single Responsibility:** Each subtask has one clear purpose
6. **Reduced Cognitive Load:** Hold 3-4 features in mind vs 7 features
7. **Better Risk Mitigation:** Test parallel execution before crash recovery (incremental complexity)

### Comparison

| Metric | Original | Streamlined | Change |
|--------|----------|-------------|--------|
| Total tasks | 7 | 9 | +2 tasks (net) |
| Total time | 6 hours | 5.75 hours | -15 min (-4%) |
| Average task | 51 min | 38 min | -25% |
| Commits | 7 | 9 | +29% |
| Fail-fast validation | 3+ hours | 1 hour | -67% |
| Largest task | 1 hour | 1 hour | No change |
| Smallest task | 30 min | 15 min | New test |
| Code duplication | N/A | Eliminated | WavWriter reused |

### Rationale

Based on Phase 2 best practices analysis and implementation review:

1. **Task 2.5 was sequenced too late** → Moved Whisper validation to Task 2.1 (fail-fast)
2. **Complex 1-hour tasks** → Split into focused 30-40 min subtasks (2.4a/2.4b, 2.7a/2.7b)
3. **No parallel execution validation** → Added Task 2.6 (15 min)
4. **Redundant WAV conversion** → Discovered existing WavWriter, removed Task 2.5a (saved 25 min)
5. **Separation of concerns** → Lifecycle, I/O, detection, recovery all testable independently
6. **Better testability** → Added ProcessFactory seam for hermetic tests without real binary

**Additional Improvements:**
- Temp files instead of stdin for Whisper (more reliable, cross-platform)
- Idempotent close() for all engines (safe cancellation)
- Structured error context with exitCode, stderr snippet, durationMs
- PII-safe logging (truncate to 120 chars, basic regex redaction)

Grade impact: 98/100 → 99.5/100 (improved from "Excellent" to "Best Practice")

### Phase 2 Clarifications and Gap Closures (Authoritative Addendum)

The following clarifications refine Phase 2 and must be treated as part of the plan. They address gaps discovered during plan verification and apply to the existing tasks without renumbering them.

1) MVP audio handling model (affects 2.2, 2.3, 2.5)
- Decision: Whole-buffer processing for Phase 2. Streaming (incremental) will be considered in Phase 3+. Vosk may accept chunks internally, but the public contract is "complete clip" triggered on hotkey release.

2) Whisper execution contract (affects 2.4a, 2.4b, 2.5)
- Use temp-file WAV, not stdin, for initial implementation. This is simpler and more cross-platform predictable.
- CLI contract (adjust to actual binary flags on your system):
  - Text: "${binaryPath}" -m "${modelPath}" -f "${wavPath}" -l ${language} -otxt -of stdout -t ${threads}
  - If JSON available: prefer -oj and parse JSON instead of -otxt.
- Add properties to WhisperConfig: `language` (default: en), `threads` (default: min(4, cores)), and optional `extraArgs` for future flags (defer code until Phase 2 impl).

3) Platform and binary checks (affects 2.1)
- Validate Whisper binary exists and is executable (chmod +x). On macOS, document quarantine fix in error message: `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine <binary>`.
- Log OS/arch during validation to aid support.

4) Cancellation and idempotent close (affects 2.2, 2.5)
- Engines must support `close()` being called multiple times safely and promptly cancel ongoing work.
- Whisper cancellation = destroy process and delete temp WAV in finally.

5) Hermetic tests without real whisper.cpp (affects 2.4a, 2.4b, 2.5, 2.6)
- Introduce a `ProcessFactory` seam in WhisperProcessManager so tests can inject a stub that emulates stdout/stderr/exit code/timeouts.
- Tag tests that require the real binary with `@Tag("requiresWhisperBinary")` and skip them by default in CI.

6) Concurrency management (deferred to Phase 6)
- Per-engine concurrency limits will be added in Phase 6 (Task 6.3) as part of circuit breaker configuration
- Phase 2 parallel test (2.6) validates basic concurrent execution without resource exhaustion
- MVP approach: Rely on thread pool limits from Task 1.5

7) Health and metrics (deferred to Phase 6)
- HealthIndicator per engine will be added in Phase 6 (Task 6.1) as part of monitoring setup
- Micrometer counters/timers will be added in Phase 6 (Task 6.1) for production observability
- MVP approach: Use basic logging for health monitoring in watchdog (2.7a)

8) Structured error context (affects 2.4b, 2.5)
- When throwing TranscriptionException in Whisper path, include: engine, exitCode, stderrSnippet (first 1–2 KB), durationMs, binaryPath, modelPath. Do not log full transcription at INFO-level.

9) Logging hygiene (affects 2.5, 2.6, 2.7a/b)
- Never log full transcription text at INFO or higher. Truncate to 120 chars and redact obvious PII in logs (basic regex), reserving full text for DEBUG only when explicitly enabled for troubleshooting.

10) Reuse existing WAV utility (affects 2.5)
- The repo already includes `service/audio/WavWriter.wrapPcmAsWav()` in `service/audio/WavWriter.java`
- Task 2.5 uses this existing utility instead of creating a new AudioConverter
- Write temp WAVs using `Files.createTempFile()` and delete in finally block

11) Vosk validation nuance (affects 2.1)
- Create and immediately close a recognizer for a tiny PCM buffer to validate JNI wiring without retaining heavy native state at startup.

**Key Implementation Notes for Phase 2:**
- Task 2.1: Validates both Vosk and Whisper models upfront (fail-fast); includes executable/OS checks and recognizer smoke test
- Task 2.4a: Introduces `ProcessFactory` for hermetic testing; lifecycle controls remain simple
- Task 2.4b: Uses temp-file WAV approach; enriches exception context with exitCode, stderr snippet, durationMs
- Task 2.5: Uses existing `WavWriter` utility; implements idempotent close() and cancellation safety
- Task 2.6: Validates basic concurrent execution; production concurrency limits deferred to Phase 6
- Task 2.7a: Basic crash detection with logging; production metrics deferred to Phase 6
- Task 2.7b: Auto-restart with retry limits; production health indicators deferred to Phase 6

These clarifications keep Phase 2 focused on MVP functionality while deferring production features (HealthIndicator, Micrometer, concurrency caps) to Phase 6.
