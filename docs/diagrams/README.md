## Diagram Technology

All diagrams are created using **Mermaid**, which renders automatically on:
- GitHub (native support)
- GitLab (native support)
- Most modern markdown viewers
- VS Code (with Mermaid extension)

### Rendering Diagrams Locally

```bash
# Install Mermaid CLI (optional, for PNG/SVG export)
npm install -g @mermaid-js/mermaid-cli

# Render to PNG
mmdc -i architecture-overview.md -o architecture-overview.png

# Render to SVG
mmdc -i architecture-overview.md -o architecture-overview.svg
```

## Contributing New Diagrams

When adding new diagrams:

1. **Use Mermaid syntax** for consistency and GitHub compatibility
2. **Add descriptive titles** using `## Diagram Name` markdown headers
3. **Include explanatory text** before each diagram
4. **Update this README** to reference your new diagram
5. **Test rendering** on GitHub before committing
6. **Keep diagrams focused** - one concept per diagram (split if > 50 nodes)
7. **Use consistent colors**:
   - Green (#c8e6c9) for success/valid states
   - Red (#ffcdd2) for errors/invalid states
   - Yellow (#ffe0b2) for warnings/intermediate states
   - Blue (#e1f5ff) for information/neutral states
