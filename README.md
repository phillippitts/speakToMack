# speakToMack

Privacy-first voice dictation for macOS using dual-engine speech-to-text (Vosk + Whisper).

## What Is This?

speakToMack lets you dictate text into any macOS application using a configurable hotkey. Unlike cloud-based solutions (Dragon, Google), all transcription happens **locally on your Mac** - your voice data never leaves your device.

## Status: üöß In Development

Current phase: Phases 0‚Äì1 complete (Environment + Core Abstractions) ‚úÖ
Next: Phase 2 ‚Äì STT Engine Integration (Vosk + Whisper)
See: [Implementation Plan](docs/IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md)

Current capabilities (implemented):
- ‚úÖ Log4j2 structured logging with MDC propagation (async console/file + audit log)
- ‚úÖ Audio format validation (16kHz, 16-bit PCM, mono) with configurable min/max durations
- ‚úÖ Domain model: TranscriptionResult
- ‚úÖ Exception hierarchy and global REST exception handler
- ‚úÖ SttEngine interface (Adapter pattern target)
- ‚úÖ Typed configuration records (VoskConfig, WhisperConfig) bound via @EnableConfigurationProperties
- ‚úÖ Thread pool configuration with MDC task decoration

Not yet implemented (planned in later phases):
- ‚ùå Vosk/Whisper engine implementations
- ‚ùå Audio capture and hotkey orchestration
- ‚ùå Reconciliation strategies
- ‚ùå Typing/paste service and fallbacks
- ‚ùå Database persistence and search

## Key Features (Planned)

- **Push-to-Talk Dictation:** Press/hold hotkey ‚Üí speak ‚Üí release ‚Üí text appears
- **Dual-Engine Transcription:** Vosk (speed) + Whisper (accuracy) run in parallel
- **100% Local:** No cloud APIs, no internet required after setup
- **Configurable Hotkeys:** YAML configuration for keyboard shortcuts
- **Graceful Fallback:** Works even if Accessibility permission denied
- **GDPR Compliant:** 90-day retention, right to erasure, IP anonymization

## Key Terms & Acronyms

### speakToMack Domain Terms
- **Reconciliation** - Process of selecting final text when Vosk and Whisper disagree
- **Fallback Manager** - System that gracefully degrades when Accessibility permission denied
- **Audio Buffer** - Thread-safe storage for captured microphone audio
- **Model Validation** - Startup check ensuring STT models are present and loadable

## Prerequisites

- macOS 12+ (Monterey or later)
- Java 21
- Microphone access permission
- Accessibility permission (for keystroke injection)
- ~200 MB disk space for STT models

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Download STT models (~200 MB)
chmod +x ./setup-models.sh
./setup-models.sh

# 2. Build and run
./gradlew bootRun

# 3. Grant permissions when prompted
# System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Accessibility
# System Settings ‚Üí Privacy & Security ‚Üí Microphone
```

### Checksum verification

The setup script verifies model integrity with SHA-256 checksums.
- On first run, if no expected checksums are provided, it computes and locks them to `models/checksums.sha256`.
- On subsequent runs, it verifies downloaded files against the locked checksums.
- To enforce official checksums, set env vars before running the script:

```bash
VOSK_SHA256=<official_sha256_for_zip> \
WHISPER_SHA256=<official_sha256_for_bin> \
./setup-models.sh
```

If upstream files are legitimately updated, either update the env vars or delete `models/checksums.sha256` to re-lock values after verifying the source.

## Verify Structured Logs

After starting the app, you can verify that structured Log4j 2 logs (with MDC values) are emitted.

1. Start the app:
   ```bash
   ./gradlew bootRun
   ```
2. In another terminal, call the ping endpoint with headers to populate MDC:
   ```bash
   curl -H 'X-Request-ID: abc123' -H 'X-User-ID: demo' http://localhost:8080/ping
   ```
3. Observe console logs. You should see a line similar to:
   ```
   2025-10-14 16:45:12.345 [http-nio-8080-exec-1] [abc123] [demo] INFO  c.p.s.presentation.controller.PingController - Ping received ‚Äî structured logging verification
   ```
   Note the requestId and userId appearing in square brackets.

## Architecture

- **3-Tier Spring Boot Application** (Presentation ‚Üí Service ‚Üí Repository)
- **Dual-Engine Processing:** Vosk and Whisper run concurrently
- **PostgreSQL Database:** Transcription history, user preferences, audit logs
- **Log4j 2 Logging:** Structured logging with MDC for request correlation
- **Strategy Pattern:** Pluggable reconciliation strategies (5 implementations)

See: [Architecture Overview](docs/diagrams/architecture-overview.md) and [Data Flow](docs/diagrams/data-flow-diagram.md)

## Configuration

The project uses Spring Boot properties (application.properties) with typed configuration classes. Current relevant settings:

```properties
# Audio validation thresholds (defaults shown)
audio.validation.min-duration-ms=250
audio.validation.max-duration-ms=300000

# Vosk (model path installed by setup-models.sh)
stt.vosk.model-path=models/vosk-model-small-en-us-0.15
stt.vosk.sample-rate=16000
stt.vosk.max-alternatives=1

# Whisper (note: you must provide a valid binary path)
stt.whisper.model-path=models/ggml-base.en.bin
stt.whisper.binary-path=<SET ME: path to whisper.cpp binary>
stt.whisper.timeout-seconds=10

# Orchestration placeholders for future phases
stt.enabled-engines=vosk,whisper
stt.parallel.timeout-ms=10000
```

Notes:
- Whisper binary is not distributed by this repo. Build whisper.cpp separately and set `stt.whisper.binary-path` to the executable (e.g., `/usr/local/bin/whisper-cpp` or `./tools/whisper.cpp/main`).
- Engines are not implemented yet; these properties are seeded to fail-fast when Phase 2 is added.

## Development

### Build

```bash
./gradlew clean build
```

### Run Tests

Where are the tests?
- src/test/java/com/phillippitts/speaktomack/SpeakToMackApplicationTests.java (Spring context load test)
- src/test/java/com/phillippitts/speaktomack/TestSpeakToMackApplication.java (test bootstrap example)
- src/test/java/com/phillippitts/speaktomack/TestcontainersConfiguration.java (test-only configuration)

How to run:
```bash
# All tests
./gradlew test

# Single class (simple name)
./gradlew test --tests SpeakToMackApplicationTests

# Single class (fully-qualified)
./gradlew test --tests com.phillippitts.speaktomack.SpeakToMackApplicationTests

# Single test method
./gradlew test --tests com.phillippitts.speaktomack.SpeakToMackApplicationTests.contextLoads
```

Notes:
- Gradle is already configured with useJUnitPlatform() (JUnit 5).
- You may see a Java 21 + Mockito warning during tests; it is harmless. A mitigation flag is already set in build.gradle: `tasks.test.jvmArgs('-XX:+EnableDynamicAgentLoading')`.
