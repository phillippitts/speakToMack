/**
 * Guards STT engine transcription operations with a semaphore to prevent concurrent overload.
 *
 * <p>This utility encapsulates the common concurrency control pattern used by both Vosk and
 * Whisper engines. It provides bounded waiting with timeout and publishes failure events
 * when concurrency limits are reached.
 *
 * <p><b>Thread Safety:</b> This class is thread-safe. The underlying {@link Semaphore}
 * handles concurrent acquire/release operations safely.
 *
 * <p><b>Usage Pattern:</b>
 * <pre>{@code
 * ConcurrencyGuard guard = new ConcurrencyGuard(
 *     new Semaphore(2),
 *     5000,
 *     "vosk",
 *     eventPublisher
 * );
 *
 * try {
 *     guard.acquire(); // Blocks until permit available or timeout
 *     // ... perform transcription ...
 * } finally {
 *     guard.release();
 * }
 * }</pre>
